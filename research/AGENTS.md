# Research Documentation

Platform capability reference for AI agents building the configuration adapter.

---

## Purpose

Factual overview of Claude Code and OpenCode platform capabilities. These documents serve as a shortcut for AI agents to understand platform-specific features, field formats, and constraints without consulting official documentation.

---

## Files

- **claude-code-docs.md** - Claude Code capabilities (skills, subagents, memory, settings, permissions)
- **opencode-docs.md** - OpenCode capabilities (agents, skills, permissions, commands, tools)

---

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Reference only** - Consult when building/adapting platform adapters or validating configurations
2. **Factual content** - Documents contain objective platform information, no recommendations
3. **Cross-reference** - Compare capabilities when designing transformation logic
4. **Validation** - Use documented constraints for field validation schemas

---

## Notes

- Documents are concise overviews, not implementation guidance
- When in doubt, verify against official documentation sources linked in each file
- Claude Code is the source format for transformations
